The title of the memoir is a reference to Mihiz's literary pseudonym, which he adopted from the initials of his name: Borislav MihajloviÄ (BM). He added the suffix -iz to create a word that sounds like "about me" (o meni) in Serbian. However, he inverted the meaning and wrote "about others" (o drugima) instead. This reflects his intention to write not only about himself but also about the people and events that shaped his life and literature.

The memoir has also been compared and contrasted with other memoirs by Serbian writers, such as Dobrica ÄosiÄ's Vreme smrti (Time of Death), Danilo KiÅ¡'s BaÅ¡ta, pepeo (Garden, Ashes), Miroslav KrleÅ¾a's Davni dani (Days Long Gone), MeÅ¡a SelimoviÄ's SjeÄanja (Memories), Branko ÄopiÄ's DoÅ¾ivljaji Nikoletine BursaÄa (The Adventures of Nikoletina BursaÄ), and others. Some have argued that Mihiz's memoir is more comprehensive and representative of Serbian literature than any other, while others have pointed out its limitations and exclusions. [^3^]
 
The memoir has also been read in the context of the political and social changes that occurred in Yugoslavia and Serbia in the late 20th century. Some have seen it as a reflection of the rise of nationalism and authoritarianism that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars in the 1990s. Others have seen it as a testimony of the resistance and dissent that challenged the official ideology and propaganda. Some have also interpreted it as a nostalgic and melancholic expression of a lost cultural heritage and identity.
 
In conclusion, Mihiz's memoir is a valuable and influential work of Serbian literature that offers a personal and professional perspective on the people and events that shaped his life and literature. It is also a controversial and contested work that provokes diverse reactions and interpretations from critics and readers. It is a work that invites further discussion and debate on the meaning and memory of the Great War from Britain, France, and Germany.
