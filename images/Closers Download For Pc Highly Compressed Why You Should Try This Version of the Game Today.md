## What is a Highly Compressed Format?
 
A highly compressed format is a type of file compression that reduces the size of a file by removing or modifying some of its data. File compression is a common technique used to save storage space and bandwidth when transferring files over the internet. There are different types of file compression, such as lossless and lossy compression.
 
Lossless compression preserves the original quality and data of the file, while lossy compression reduces the quality and data of the file to achieve a higher compression ratio. A highly compressed format is usually a lossy compression that sacrifices some aspects of the file, such as graphics, audio, or gameplay features, to make it smaller.
