# FSX Orientalsim Nairobi Intl India: A Collection of Digital Artworks Inspired by Flight Simulation
 
FSX Orientalsim Nairobi Intl India is a collection of digital artworks created by various artists using Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) and Orientalsim Nairobi Intl scenery. The collection features realistic and artistic representations of the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), the largest airport in Kenya and one of the busiest in Africa, as well as the surrounding landscapes and cityscapes of Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya.
 
The collection was launched on OpenSea, a platform for buying and selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique digital assets that can represent anything from art to music to games. NFTs are powered by blockchain technology, which ensures their authenticity and ownership. The collection aims to showcase the beauty and diversity of Kenya, as well as the creativity and passion of flight simulation enthusiasts.

- A stylized depiction of a Boeing 737 taking off from JKIA, with a colorful background of geometric shapes and patterns.
- A surrealistic image of a lion roaring in front of JKIA, symbolizing the strength and pride of Kenya.
- A minimalist illustration of a giraffe standing next to a Cessna 172 parked at JKIA, representing the harmony between nature and technology.
- A collage of various landmarks and attractions in Nairobi, such as the Kenyatta International Convention Centre, the Nairobi National Park, and the Uhuru Park.

The collection has received positive feedback from both flight simulation fans and NFT collectors, who praised the originality and quality of the artworks. The collection also attracted attention from media outlets and influencers, who featured it on their platforms and social media accounts. The collection has generated over $10,000 in sales so far, with some items selling for more than $1,000 each.
 
The creators of the collection plan to expand it with more items in the future, as well as collaborate with other artists and flight simulation developers. They hope that their collection will inspire more people to explore and appreciate Kenya, as well as the world of flight simulation.
  
Aside from creating digital artworks, some of the creators of the collection are also passionate about real-world flight simulation and aviation. They have enrolled in various flight schools in Kenya, such as the [Kenya School of Flying](https://kenyaschoolofflying.com/), the [Ninety Nines Flying School](https://99flying.com/), and the [Capital Connect Aviation](https://capitalconnect.co.ke/). These schools offer professional pilot training programs for private, commercial, and airline sectors, as well as access to modern flight simulators and aircraft.
 
Flight simulation is a growing hobby and career option in Kenya, as more people are interested in learning how to fly and exploring the world from a different perspective. However, there are also some challenges and limitations that face flight simulation enthusiasts in Kenya, such as the high cost of training, the lack of infrastructure and facilities, and the scarcity of flight simulators and instructors. According to [Disciples of Flight](https://disciplesofflight.com/simulators-flight-training-in-kenya/), a website dedicated to aviation news and stories, there are only three serviceable flight training devices in Kenya, out of 17 active flight schools.
