# L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes: A Powerful Tool for Audio Production
 
L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes is a plugin that offers look-ahead brickwall peak limiting, level maximization, and ultra high resolution for mixing, mastering, and more[^1^]. It is based on the L2 Ultramaximizer plugin from Waves, which is an industry-standard tool for audio production[^2^]. L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes adds some features and enhancements to the original plugin, such as:
 
- A new algorithm that reduces distortion and preserves transients.
- A variable release time that adapts to the input signal.
- A dithering option that minimizes noise and quantization errors.
- A 23golkes mode that boosts the output level by 23 dB.

L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes is compatible with most DAWs and supports VST, AU, AAX, and RTAS formats. It is available for Windows and Mac OS X platforms. L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes is a must-have plugin for anyone who wants to achieve loudness, clarity, and quality in their audio projects.

## How to use L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes?
 
L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes is designed to be simple and easy to use. It has only a few controls that allow you to adjust the threshold, output ceiling, release time, quantization, dithering, and shaping of your audio signal. Here are the steps to use L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes:

1. Load the plugin on your master track or bus as the last plugin in your chain.
2. Set the output ceiling to the desired level. This is the maximum level that your audio signal will reach after limiting. A common value is -0.3 dBFS.
3. Lower the threshold until you see some gain reduction on the attenuation meter. This is the amount of limiting that is applied to your audio signal. The lower the threshold, the more limiting and loudness you will get.
4. Adjust the release time according to your preference. This is how fast the limiter returns to its normal state after limiting. A shorter release time will result in a more aggressive and punchy sound, while a longer release time will result in a more smooth and natural sound.
5. Select the quantize option that matches your output bit resolution. This is how many bits are used to represent your audio signal after limiting. A higher bit resolution will result in a higher quality sound, while a lower bit resolution will result in a lower quality sound.
6. Select the dither type that suits your needs. This is a process that adds low-level noise to your audio signal to reduce quantization errors and distortion. A higher dither type will result in a more transparent sound, while a lower dither type will result in a more colored sound.
7. Select the shaping option that sounds best to your ears. This is a process that modifies the frequency spectrum of your audio signal to enhance its perceived loudness and quality. A higher shaping option will result in a brighter and sharper sound, while a lower shaping option will result in a darker and smoother sound.
8. Optionally, activate the 23golkes mode if you want to increase your output level by 23 dB. This is a special feature of L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes that allows you to achieve extreme loudness without clipping or distorting your audio signal. Use this mode with caution and only if you know what you are doing.

That's it! You have successfully used L2 Ultramaximizer 23golkes to master your audio track. You can now compare the before and after results by bypassing or muting the plugin. You can also compare it with the original L2 Ultramaximizer plugin from Waves by loading it on another track or bus and using the same settings.
