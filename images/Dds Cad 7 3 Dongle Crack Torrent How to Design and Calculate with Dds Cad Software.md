## What is a dongle emulator?
 
A dongle emulator is a software that mimics the function of a hardware dongle. A dongle is a small device that plugs into a USB port and contains a unique serial number and encryption code that authorizes the software to run. A dongle emulator creates a virtual dongle on your computer that fools the software into thinking that you have a real dongle attached.
