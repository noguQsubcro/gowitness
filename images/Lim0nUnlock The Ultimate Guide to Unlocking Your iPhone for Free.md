## What is Lim0nUnlock?
 
Lim0nUnlock is a software that was created by an unknown developer and released on a blog in 2014. According to the blog post[^1^], Lim0nUnlock is "the easiest method / program that unlock iPhone for free and permanently". The software claims to unlock iPhone directly over Apple Database, meaning that the unlock will remain even after updating the iOS version. The blog post also claims that Lim0nUnlock supports all iPhone models, basebands, firmware, countries, and carriers.
 
## How does Lim0nUnlock work?
 
The blog post[^1^] provides a download link for Lim0nUnlock 0.2.4, which is supposed to be the latest version of the software. The download link leads to a file hosting site that requires completing a survey or an offer before accessing the file. After downloading the file, the user needs to install Lim0nUnlock on their computer and connect their iPhone to it via USB cable. The software will then detect the iPhone model and firmware and start the unlocking process. The user will need to wait for a few minutes until the software confirms that the unlock is successful. The user will then need to disconnect their iPhone and restart it. The iPhone should be unlocked and ready to use with any SIM card.
 
## What are the pros and cons of using Lim0nUnlock?
 
As with any software that claims to offer free services, there are some advantages and disadvantages of using Lim0nUnlock. Here are some of them:
 
- **Pros:**
- It is free and does not require any payment or subscription.

## Conclusion
 
Lim0nUnlock is a software that claims to unlock iPhone for free and permanently. However, there is no evidence or guarantee that it works as promised or that it is safe to use. Therefore, we do not recommend using Lim0nUnlock or any similar software for unlocking your iPhone. Instead, we suggest contacting your carrier or a reputable third-party service provider for a legitimate and reliable unlocking solution.
